## Project Overview
This repository contains a trading strategy implementation with multiple enhancements focused on improving risk management and performance metrics. The strategy has been developed and refined in several iterations, with each version demonstrating different performance characteristics.

## Key Files
- **refine_strategy_v2.py**: The latest enhanced strategy implementation with improved risk management
- **refine_strategy.py**: The first enhanced version of the strategy 
- **analyze_*.py**: Various analysis scripts for market conditions, seasonality, signal comparison, etc.
- **strategy_improvements_summary.md**: Comprehensive summary of strategy enhancements and performance metrics
- **results/**: Directory containing all analysis outputs, plots, and CSV files

## Strategy Performance
The Enhanced V2 strategy demonstrates significantly improved risk metrics compared to the original:
- Lower volatility (61.18% vs 69.46%)
- Better Sharpe ratio (2.14 vs 1.84)
- Better Sortino ratio (1.73 vs 1.54)
- Better Calmar ratio (3.43 vs 2.65)
- Lower maximum drawdown (-38.17% vs -48.18%)
- Higher win rate (66.96% vs 61.84%)
- Better profit factor (1.70 vs 1.43)

For a detailed breakdown, see the strategy_improvements_summary.md file.

## Recent Changes
All analysis scripts and strategy implementations have been committed locally. Two commits have been made:
1. "Add enhanced trading strategy with improved risk management and comprehensive strategy analysis"
2. "Add analysis scripts and comprehensive performance reports"

## How to Push Changes
To push these changes to the remote repository, you need proper authentication:

```bash
# Option 1: Configure Git with a personal access token
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/BonelessWater/InvestmentProposal2-Algo.git
git push

# Option 2: Use SSH instead of HTTPS
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:BonelessWater/InvestmentProposal2-Algo.git
git push
```

You may need to generate a personal access token in GitHub (Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens) or set up SSH keys if you haven't already.
